## Architecture overview

MediaStore API Example is a frontend application build with React. It was bootstrapped with Create React App. We are using a webpack to build it, Jest, and Enzyme for testing, Styled Components for styles.

This application is communicating with the backend REST API. All methods available can be found [here](https://developers.cleeng.com/reference/getting-started).

<b>The app requires params to working properly. </b>

To enable login action pass `offerId` to the app. Login is also possible using `publisherId`, but in the sample app, we use `offerId`.
To enable registration, pass `publisherId` which is required to fetch terms and conditions.

You can pass it in two ways:

In URL as a param `?offer=S1234567` / `?publisher=123456789` and this is the most important one

In local storage as `CLEENG_OFFER_ID` / `CLEENG_PUBLISHER_ID`

<b>Sample:`http://localhost:3003/login?offer=S817681481_PL&publisher=933103327`</b>
